<h2>General APA FAQs</h2>
<div id="resourcebox"><p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p><p>APA (American 
Psychological Association) style is most commonly used to cite sources 
within the social sciences. This resource, revised according to the 6<sup>th</sup>
 edition, second printing of the APA manual, offers examples for the 
general format of APA research papers, in-text citations, 
endnotes/footnotes, and the reference page. For more information, please
 consult the <em>Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</em>, (6<sup>th</sup> ed., 2<sup>nd</sup> printing).</p>  <p></p>

	<p>The following FAQs address issues in APA citation and/or formatting.
 The entries in this section are based on frequently asked questions 
received by our former OWL Mail Tutors. Also, Further information on APA
 style and citation can be found at the <a title="Purdue OWL: APA Style" href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/2/10/">Purdue OWL’s APA Style and Formatting</a> resource.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>I’m writing an APA style paper, but I can’t get the header 
on the first page to be different than the subsequent pages. How do I 
set a different header on the first page?</strong></h3>
<p>If you are using <em>Word</em> 2007, you can make the header of the 
first page different from the header on the second and following pages. 
To do this, please follow these steps:<br> <br> 1. After opening <em>Word</em> 2007, click on "Insert" at the top of the page.<br> 2. Click on "Header" and choose the Header template you wish to use. Type<br> in the text you would like for the first page.<br> 3.When you type in your text in the header, you will see the "Design" tab<br> is highlighted. There you can click on "Different first page." This will<br> allow you to type in different text within your header beginning with page<br> two.<br> <br> If you do not have a version of <em>Word</em> which allows you to do this, you can simply type “Running Head: SHORTENED<br> TITLE OF YOUR PAPER” at the upper most line on the first page without<br> typing it inside the header. Then type the shortened title inside the<br> header as you wish it to appear throughout your document.</p>
<h3><strong>Using APA, how do I cite an author if their work is referenced more than once in a single paragraph? </strong></h3>
<p>Here’s what the 6<sup>th</sup> edition of the APA manual says: 
"Within a paragraph, when the name of the author is part of the 
narrative...you need not include the year in subsequent nonparenthetical
 references to a study as long as the study cannot be confused with 
other studies cited in the article. Do include the year in all 
parenthetical citations" (pg. 174).<br> <br> In other words, every time you bring up the author in a new paragraph, you<br>
 should use the year, but you don’t have to within a paragraph, as long 
as&nbsp;it’s clear from your wording that you are discussing the same 
author. If&nbsp;you were giving a direct quotation that needed a 
parenthetical reference&nbsp;for the page number, then you’d include the
 year as well.</p>
<h3><strong>How do I cite a work that has no listed author in an APA-style paper?</strong></h3>
<p>According to the OWL website’s resource on APA-style citations, "When
 your essay includes parenthetical citations of sources with no author 
named, use a shortened version of the source’s title instead of an 
author’s name. Use quotation marks and italics as appropriate. For 
example, parenthetical citations of the source above would appear as 
follows: (<em>Merriam-Webster’s</em> 1993)." The bibliographical citation is as follows:<br> <br> <em>Merriam-Webster’s collegiate dictionary </em>(10<sup>th</sup> ed.).(1993). Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster.</p>
<h3><strong>What do I do if the source-type that I’m using doesn’t appear in any APA reference/style guides?</strong></h3>
<p>The APA manual models several different templates for references, but
 the forms given may not apply to all documents. In this case, the APA 
manual states that you should format the entry as best you can in 
accordance with their models:<br> <br> "Occasionally, however, you may 
need to use a reference for a source for which this chapter does not 
provide specific guidance. In such a case choose the example that is 
most like your source and follow that format...When in doubt, provide 
more information rather than less." (American Psychological Association,
 2009 p. 193).&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What do I do if a website is missing information required for an APA-style citation?</strong></h3>
<p><a title="APA Style Blog" href="http://blog.apastyle.org/"> The APA Style Blog</a> is a helpful source when it comes to citing websites with missing information.&nbsp;<br> <br>
 For example, if your website has no author, you can use the following 
example as a template for the citation for your reference page:<br> <br>
 All 33 Chile miners freed in flawless rescue. (2010, October 13). 
Retrieved from http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39625809/ns/world_news-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;americas/<br> <br> As you can see, the title of the document is moved up to where the author’s name would be.<br> <br> If your website has no date, you can put "n.d." instead. For example:<br> <br>
 The College of William and Mary. (n.d.). College mission statement. 
Retrieved from http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/provost<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;/mission/index.php</p>
<h3><strong>If I co-author a paper, how should the author’s names appear in an APA-style title page?</strong></h3>
<p>According to the 6<sup>th</sup> edition of the APA manual, "The names
 of the authors should appear in the order of their contributions, 
centered between the side margins. For names with suffixes (e.g., Jr. 
and III), separate the suffix from the rest of the name with a space 
instead of a comma. The institutional affiliation should be centered 
under the author’s name, on the next line" (p. 24).<br> <br> Some examples include the following:<br> <br> Two authors, one affiliation:<br> <br> John Q. Foster II and Roy R. Davis Jr.<br> Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey<br> <br> Three authors, one affiliation:<br> <br> Juanita Fuentes, Paul Dykes, and Susan Watanabe<br> University of Colorado at Boulder<br> <br> Two authors, two affiliations:<br> <br> David Wolf<br> University of California, Berkeley<br> Amanda Blue<br> Brandon University<br> <br> Three authors, two affiliations:<br> <br> Mariah Meade and Sylvia Earleywine<br> Georgetown University</p>
<h3><strong>I’m including clip art in my APA style <em>PowerPoint</em> presentation. How do I properly cite the clip art that I’m going to use?</strong></h3>
<p>If you are using the clip art simply to adorn your <em>PowerPoint</em> presentation, you don’t need to cite it. The 6<sup>th </sup>Edition
 of the APA manual does not offer a specific discussion of this issue, 
but it seems unnecessary to provide citation on a document presented via
 the Microsoft program for stock images that a specific to that software
 package.<br> <br> However, if the clip art is presented in a separate 
medium (like a handout), and you want to be very thorough about citation
 or if your presentation is specifically about clip art and the point is
 to discuss clip art from different sources, then you should cite the 
source. Here is the format you should follow:<br> <br> Title of Program (Version number)[Description of format]. Location: Name<br> of producer.<br> <br> Here’s the example in the 6<sup>th</sup> Edition of the APA manual:<br> <br></p>
<p>Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Version 2) [Computer Software]. Englwood, NJ:<br> Biostat.<br> <br>
 For the clip art from on-line sources, because these are texts that are
 relocated from an outside source, you should probably cite them 
regardless of the situation. Here’s the format:<br> <br> Name of image creator, A. A. (Year images was made). Title of image in<br> italics [medium of image - i.e file type]. Retrieved from http://.....</p>
<h3><strong>How do I cite unpublished works in APA?</strong></h3>
<p>Here is the relevant format from the APA manual, 6<sup>th</sup> edition, p. 211:<br> <br> Unpublished manuscripts with a university cited:<br> <br> Blackwell, E., &amp; Conrod, P.J. (2003). <em>A five dimensional measure of</em><em><br> drinking motives</em>. Unpublished manuscript, Department of<br> Psychology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.<br> <br> Manuscript in progress or submitted for publication:<br> <br> Ting, J. Y., Florsheim, P., &amp; Huang, W. (2008). <em>Mental health help-seeking</em><em><br> in ethnic minority populations: A theoretical perspective</em>.<br> Manuscript submitted for publication [or "Manuscript in preparation"].<br> <br>
 Along with the format for the latter work, you can add the 
university&nbsp;where the author works (if indeed they are doing 
research as part of their&nbsp;position with a university or 
college).&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>I’m writing a paper about computer-aided writing instruction. How do I cite pieces of software in APA?</strong></h3>
<p>According to the 6<sup>th</sup> edition of the APA manual, here is the general format<br> for citing software:<br> <br> Rightsholder, A.A. (Year). Title of program (Version number) [Description<br> of form]. Location: Name of producer.<br> <br> Alternatively, instead of using "Location:..." you can use "Retrieved from<br> http://www...."<br> <br> If you can't find who the rightsholder is (i.e. the company or person who<br> made the software), you can start the citation with the name of the<br> program.<br> <br> Here’s another example from the manual:<br> <br> Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Version 2) [Computer software]. Englewood,<br> NJ: Biostat.<br> <br> The date may be excluded if it is not available.<br> <br>
 If you are citing a piece of software for a smartphone of a video game 
console, I would use the most descriptive term for the kind of software 
you’re using, i.e., [iPhone application].&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How do I cite my professor’s classroom <em>PowerPoint </em>presentations in APA?</strong></h3>
<p>Your first choice is to follow the format for online <em>PowerPoint</em> presentation slides exemplified on <a title="Purdue OWL: APA References Lists" href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/10/">this page of the Purdue OWL</a>, and to simply not include the url:</p>
<p>You would reference this source in-text as you normally would by the author’s last name and date.<br> <br> Your second choice is to refer to the lecture as personal communication. For an example, please see <a title="Purdue OWL: APA References List: Other Print Sources" href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/11/">this resource on the Purdue OWL</a>.</p>
<p>Please note: personal communication is only cited in-text and not within your<br> References list.</p>
<h3><strong>How do I cite lecture notes in my APA-style research paper?</strong></h3>
<p>The citation on the Reference page for the lecture notes would look like the following in APA:<br> <br>
 Author. (year). In italics write the name or title of the lecture. 
Personal Collection of (the lecturer’s name), school or organization 
they teach for, city, state.<br> <br> Berliner, A. (1959). Lecture on Reminiscences of Wundt and Leipsig.<br>Personal Collection of A. Berliner, University of Akron, Akron OH.</p>
<h3><strong>How do I cite a work of art, like Salvador Dali’s <em>The Ecumenical Council</em>, in APA?</strong></h3>
<p>There is no “official” APA citation style for paintings or other 
works of&nbsp;art, but the APA Style Blog recently addressed this 
question with the&nbsp;in a recent post. You can access that post by <a title="APA Style Blog: Citing Art" href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2010/04/theres-an-art-to-it.html">clicking here</a>. <br> <br>
 As they say, "There are no guidelines for paintings, sculptures, or 
more&nbsp;complicated installations (e.g., a chair, a photo of a chair, 
and a&nbsp;definition of “chair”). So let’s use the Franken reference 
concept to model&nbsp;a few ways to handle art in your reference list."<br> <br> The basic format they suggest is below (using Wyeth’s painting <em>Christina’s&nbsp;</em><em>world</em> as an example:<br> <br> Wyeth, A. (1948). <em>Christina’s world</em> [Painting]. Retrieved from<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.moma.org/explore/collection/index</p>
<h3><strong>I created and administered my own survey for a project. How would I cite this survey in an APA-style paper?</strong></h3>
<p>Since a survey you conducted yourself is not published elsewhere by 
someone else, you do not cite it in the same way you cite other 
materials. Instead, in your paper you describe your survey and make it 
clear that the data you’re referring to is from the survey, usually by 
saying so in introductory sentences. In your paper, you should include a
 short overview of your survey method: whom the survey was administered 
to, how it was administered, how many responses you got, and what kind 
of questions you asked. You should include a copy of the survey 
instrument (the full set of questions asked) as an appendix to your 
paper. You do not need to include your survey in your works cited list.</p>
<h3><strong>How does one cite state bills in APA?</strong></h3>
<p>APA follows the guidelines for legal citations in the United States as outlined in <em>The Bluebook<sup>®</sup></em>. You can access a version of The Bluebook by <a title="The Bluebook" href="http://www.legalbluebook.com/Public/Introduction.aspx">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>However, guidelines for references to legal materials can also be found on<br> pages 216-224 in the 6<sup>th</sup> of the <em>Publication Manual of the APA</em>.<br> The following sample reference to a statute in a state code and its<br> explanation can be found on page 220:<br> <br> Mental Care and Treatment Act, 4 Kan. Stat. Ann.§§ 59-2901-2941 (1983 &amp;<br> Supp. 1992).<br> <br>
 Explanation: This Kansas act can be found in codified version 
between&nbsp;sections 2901 and 2941 in Chapter 59 of volume 4 of the 
1983 edition of&nbsp;Kansas Statutes Annotated. Two amendments to the 
act and additional&nbsp;references are provided in the 1992 supplement 
for the Kansas Statutes&nbsp;Annotated.</p>
<h3><strong>How do I cite artifacts in an APA-style paper?</strong></h3>
<p>Artifacts may fall under "Archival Documents and Collections." &nbsp;An extensive explanation of this can be found in the 6<sup>th </sup>edition of the APA publication manual. The general format for this reference is as follows:<br> <br> Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). <em>Title of material</em>. [Description of<br> material]. Name of Collection (Call number, Box number, File name or<br> number, etc.). Name of Repository, Location.</p>
<p><br> This general format may be modified for collections requiring 
more or less&nbsp;specific information to locate materials, for

<h3><strong>How do I cite a products instructional guide (e.g., the Apple iPad user’s manual) in APA?</strong></h3>
<p>While the APA publication manual lists many different references, 
product instructions are not something that has a specific reference 
example. Since there is not a specific reference guideline for 
instructions, I would adapt another similar reference for your uses. For
 example:<br> <br> Title of the Instructions (Year). <em>Name of the product</em>. Company Name, City, State. Current Location of the Product.<br> <br>
 Note: If the product is maintained at a business, list the name of the 
business and city, state for the "current location of product." If you 
own the product you are referencing, list "Copy in possession of 
author."</p>
<h3><strong>How do I cite genealogies in APA?</strong></h3>
<p>The APA does not seem to specifically address this issue, probably 
because it is very particular. Here’s what we’ve been able to find from 
other sources:<br> <br></p>
<p>Genealogy.com offers a method of citing birth/death certificates, which can be found by <a title="Genealogy.com: Citing Birth/Death Certificates" href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/http:/www.genealogy.com/19_wylie.html">clicking here</a> and scrolling down to the “Official Records” section of the page.</p>
<p>Archive.gov also offers suggestions on how to cite birth/death certificates, which can be accessed by <a title="Archives.org: Citing Records in the National Archives" href="http://www.archives.gov/publications/general-info-leaflets/17-citing-records.html">clicking here</a>.</p>
