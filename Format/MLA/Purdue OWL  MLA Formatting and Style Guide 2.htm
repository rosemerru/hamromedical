<h2>MLA In-Text Citations: The Basics</h2>
<div id="resourcebox"><p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p><p>MLA (Modern 
Language Association) style is most commonly used to write papers and 
cite sources within the liberal arts and humanities. This resource, 
updated to reflect the <em>MLA Handbook</em> (8<sup>th</sup> ed.), 
offers examples for the general format of MLA research papers, in-text 
citations, endnotes/footnotes, and the Works Cited page.<strong></strong></p>  <p></p>

	<p>Guidelines for referring to the works of others in your text using MLA style are covered in chapter 6 of the <em>MLA Handbook</em> and in chapter 7 of the <em>MLA Style Manual</em>.
 Both books provide extensive examples, so it's a good idea to consult 
them if you want to become even more familiar with MLA guidelines or if 
you have a particular reference question.</p>
<h4>Basic in-text citation rules</h4>
<p>In MLA style, referring to the works of others in your text is done by using what is known as <strong>parenthetical citation</strong>. This method involves placing relevant source information in parentheses after a quote or a paraphrase.</p>
<p><strong>General Guidelines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The source information required in a parenthetical citation depends 
(1.) upon the source medium (e.g. Print, Web, DVD) and (2.) upon the 
source’s entry on the Works Cited (bibliography) page. </li>
<li>Any source information that you provide in-text must correspond to 
the source information on the Works Cited page. More specifically, 
whatever signal word or phrase you provide to your readers in the text, 
must be the first thing that appears on the left-hand margin of the 
corresponding entry in the Works Cited List.</li>
</ul>
<h4>In-text citations: Author-page style</h4>
<p>MLA format follows the author-page method of in-text citation. This 
means that the author's last name and the page number(s) from which the 
quotation or paraphrase is taken must appear in the text, and a complete
 reference should appear on your Works Cited page. The author's name may
 appear either in the sentence itself or in parentheses following the 
quotation or paraphrase, but the page number(s) should always appear in 
the parentheses, not in the text of your sentence. For example:</p>
<div class="example">Wordsworth stated that Romantic poetry was marked by a "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" (263). <br><br>Romantic poetry is characterized by the "spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" (Wordsworth 263).</div>
<div class="example">Wordsworth extensively explored the role of emotion in the creative process (263).</div>
<p>Both citations in the examples above, (263) and (Wordsworth 263), 
tell readers that the information in the sentence can be located on page
 263 of a work by an author named Wordsworth. If readers want more 
information about this source, they can turn to the Works Cited page, 
where, under the name of Wordsworth, they would find the following 
information:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Wordsworth, William. <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>. Oxford UP, 1967.</p>
</div>
<h4>In-text citations for print sources with known author</h4>
<p>For Print sources like books, magazines, scholarly journal articles, 
and newspapers, provide a signal word or phrase (usually the author’s 
last name) and a page number. If you provide the signal word/phrase in 
the sentence, you do not need to include it in the parenthetical 
citation.</p>
<div class="example">Human beings have been described by Kenneth Burke as "symbol-using animals" (3).</div>
<div class="example">Human beings have been described as "symbol-using animals" (Burke 3).</div>
<p>These examples must correspond to an entry that begins with Burke, 
which will be the first thing that appears on the left-hand margin of an
 entry in the Works Cited:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Burke, Kenneth. <em>Language as Symbolic Action: Essays on Life, Literature, and Method</em>. Berkeley: U of California P, 1966.</p>
</div>
<h4>In-text citations for print sources by a corporate author</h4>
<p>When a source has a corporate author, it is acceptable to use the 
name of the corporation followed by the page number for the in-text 
citation. You should also use abbreviations (e.g., nat'l for national) 
where appropriate, so as to avoid interrupting the flow of reading with 
overly long parenthetical citations.</p>
<h4>In-text citations for print sources with no known author</h4>
<p>When a source has no known author, use a shortened title of the work 
instead of an author name. Place the title in quotation marks if it's a 
short work (such as an article) or italicize it if it's a longer work 
(e.g. plays, books, television shows, entire Web sites) and provide a 
page number.</p>
<div class="example">We see so many global warming hotspots in North 
America likely because this region has "more readily accessible climatic
 data and more comprehensive programs to monitor and study environmental
 change . . ." ("Impact of Global Warming" 6).</div>
<p>In this example, since the reader does not know the author of the 
article, an abbreviated title of the article appears in the 
parenthetical citation which corresponds to the full name of the article
 which appears first at the left-hand margin of its respective entry in 
the Works Cited. Thus, the writer includes the title in quotation marks 
as the signal phrase in the parenthetical citation in order to lead the 
reader directly to the source on the Works Cited page. The Works Cited 
entry appears as follows:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">"The Impact of Global Warming in North America." <em>Global Warming: Early Signs</em>. 1999. http://www.climatehotmap.org/. Accessed 23 Mar. 2009.</p>
</div>
<p>We'll learn how to make a Works Cited page in a bit, but right now 
it's important to know that parenthetical citations and Works Cited 
pages allow readers to know which sources you consulted in writing your 
essay, so that they can either verify your interpretation of the sources
 or use them in their own scholarly work.</p>
<h4>Author-page citation for classic and literary works with multiple editions</h4>
<p>Page numbers are always required, but additional citation information
 can help literary scholars, who may have a different edition of a 
classic work like Marx and Engels's <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>. In
 such cases, give the page number of your edition (making sure the 
edition is listed in your Works Cited page, of course) followed by a 
semicolon, and then the appropriate abbreviations for volume (vol.), 
book (bk.), part (pt.), chapter (ch.), section (sec.), or paragraph 
(par.). For example:</p>
<div class="example">Marx and Engels described human history as marked by class struggles (79; ch. 1).</div>
<h4>Citing authors with same last names</h4>
<p>Sometimes more information is necessary to identify the source from 
which a quotation is taken. For instance, if two or more authors have 
the same last name, provide both authors' first initials (or even the 
authors' full name if different authors share initials) in your 
citation. For example:</p>
<div class="example">Although some medical ethicists claim that cloning 
will lead to designer children (R. Miller 12), others note that the 
advantages for medical research outweigh this consideration (A. Miller 
46).</div>
<h4>Citing a work by multiple authors</h4>
<p>For a source with two authors, list the authors’ last names in the text or in the parenthetical citation:</p>
<div class="example">Best and Marcus argue that one should read a text 
for what it says on its surface, rather than looking for some hidden 
meaning (9).</div>
<div class="example">The authors claim that surface reading looks at what is “evident, perceptible, apprehensible in texts” (Best and Marcus 9).</div>
<p>Corresponding works cited entry:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Best, David, and Sharon Marcus. “Surface Reading: An Introduction.” <em>Representations</em>, vol. 108, no. 1, Fall 2009, pp. 1-21. JSTOR, doi:10.1525/rep.2009.108.1.1</p>
</div>
<p>For a source with three or more authors, list only the first author’s last name, and replace the additional names with et al.</p>
<div class="example">According to Franck et al., “Current agricultural policies in the U.S. are contributing to the poor health of Americans” (327).</div>
<div class="example">The authors claim that one cause of obesity in the United States is government-funded farm subsidies (Franck et al. 327).</div>
<p>Corresponding works cited entry:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Franck, Caroline, et al. “Agricultural Subsidies and the American Obesity Epidemic.” <em>American Journal of Preventative Medicine</em>, vol. 45, no. 3, Sept. 2013, pp. 327-333.</p>
</div>
<h4>Citing multiple works by the same author</h4>
<p>If you cite more than one work by a particular author, include a 
shortened title for the particular work from which you are quoting to 
distinguish it from the others. Put short titles of books in italics and
 short titles of articles in quotation marks.<br><br><em>Citing two articles by the same author</em>:</p>
<div class="example">Lightenor has argued that computers are not useful 
tools for small children ("Too Soon" 38), though he has acknowledged 
elsewhere that early exposure to computer games does lead to better 
small motor skill development in a child's second and third year 
("Hand-Eye Development" 17).</div>
<p><em>Citing two books by the same author</em>:</p>
<div class="example">Murray states that writing is "a process" that "varies with our thinking style" (<em>Write to Learn</em>
 6). Additionally, Murray argues that the purpose of writing is to 
"carry ideas and information from the mind of one person into the mind 
of another" (<em>A Writer Teaches Writing</em> 3).</div>
<p>Additionally, if the author's name is not mentioned in the sentence, 
you would format your citation with the author's name followed by a 
comma, followed by a shortened title of the work, followed, when 
appropriate, by page numbers:</p>
<div class="example">Visual studies, because it is such a new discipline, may be "too easy" (Elkins, "Visual Studies" 63).</div>
<h4>Citing multivolume works</h4>
<p>If you cite from different volumes of a multivolume work, always 
include the volume number followed by a colon. Put a space after the 
colon, then provide the page number(s). (If you only cite from one 
volume, provide only the page number in parentheses.)</p>
<div class="example">. . . as Quintilian wrote in <em>Institutio Oratoria</em> (1: 14-17).</div>
<h4>Citing the Bible</h4>
<p>In your first parenthetical citation, you want to make clear which 
Bible you're using (and underline or italicize the title), as each 
version varies in its translation, followed by book (do not italicize or
 underline), chapter and verse. For example:</p>
<div class="example">Ezekiel saw "what seemed to be four living creatures," each with faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle (<em>New Jerusalem Bible</em>, Ezek. 1.5-10).</div>
<p>If future references employ the same edition of the Bible you’re 
using, list only the book, chapter, and verse in the parenthetical 
citation.</p>
<h4>Citing indirect sources</h4>
<p>Sometimes you may have to use an indirect source. An indirect source 
is a source cited in another source. For such indirect quotations, use 
"qtd. in" to indicate the source you actually consulted. For example:</p>
<div class="example">Ravitch argues that high schools are pressured to 
act as "social service centers, and they don't do that well" (qtd. in 
Weisman 259).</div>
<p>Note that, in most cases, a responsible researcher will attempt to 
find the original source, rather than citing an indirect source.</p>
<h4>Citing non-print or sources from the Internet</h4>
<p>With more and more scholarly work being posted on the Internet, you 
may have to cite research you have completed in virtual environments. 
While many sources on the Internet should not be used for scholarly work
 (reference the OWL's <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/553/01/">Evaluating Sources of Information</a>
 resource), some Web sources are perfectly acceptable for research. When
 creating in-text citations for electronic, film, or Internet sources, 
remember that your citation must reference the source in your Works 
Cited.</p>
<p>Sometimes writers are confused with how to craft parenthetical 
citations for electronic sources because of the absence of page numbers,
 but often, these sorts of entries do not require any sort of 
parenthetical citation at all. For electronic and Internet sources, 
follow the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include in the text the first item that appears in the Work Cited 
entry that corresponds to the citation (e.g. author name, article name, 
website name, film name).</li>
<li>You do not need to give paragraph numbers or page numbers based on your Web browser’s print preview function.</li>
<li>Unless you must list the Web site name in the signal phrase in order
 to get the reader to the appropriate entry, do not include URLs 
in-text. Only provide partial URLs such as when the name of the site 
includes, for example, a domain name, like <em>CNN.com</em> or <em>Forbes.com</em> as opposed to writing out http://www.cnn.com or http://www.forbes.com.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Miscellaneous non-print sources</h4>
<div class="example">Werner Herzog's <em>Fitzcarraldo</em> stars Herzog's long-time film partner, Klaus Kinski. During the shooting of <em>Fitzcarraldo</em>, Herzog and Kinski were often at odds, but their explosive relationship fostered a memorable and influential film.</div>
<div class="example">During the presentation, Jane Yates stated that invention and pre-writing are areas of rhetoric that need more attention.</div>
<p>In the two examples above “Herzog” from the first entry and “Yates” 
from the second lead the reader to the first item each citation’s 
respective entry on the Works Cited page:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Herzog, Werner, dir. <em>Fitzcarraldo</em>. Perf. Klaus Kinski. Filmverlag der Autoren, 1982.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Yates, Jane. "Invention in Rhetoric and 
Composition." Gaps Addressed: Future Work in Rhetoric and Composition, 
CCCC, Palmer House Hilton, 2002.</p>
</div>
<h4>Electronic sources</h4>
<div class="example">One online film critic stated that <em>Fitzcarraldo</em> "has become notorious for its near-failure and many obstacles" (Taylor, “Fitzcarraldo”).</div>
<div class="example">The <em>Purdue OWL</em> is accessed by millions of 
users every year. Its "MLA Formatting and Style Guide" is one of the 
most popular resources (Russell et al.).</div>
<p>In the first example, the writer has chosen not to include the author
 name in-text; however, two entries from the same author appear in the 
Works Cited. Thus, the writer includes both the author’s last name and 
the article title in the parenthetical citation in order to lead the 
reader to the appropriate entry on the Works Cited page (see below). In 
the second example, “Russell et al.” in the parenthetical citation gives
 the reader an author name followed by the abbreviation “et al.,” 
meaning, “and others,” for the article “MLA Formatting and Style Guide.”
 Both corresponding Works Cited entries are as follows:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Taylor, Rumsey. "Fitzcarraldo." <em>Slant</em>, 13 Jun. 2003, www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/fitzcarraldo/.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Russell, Tony, et al. "MLA Formatting and Style Guide." <em>The Purdue OWL</em>, 2 Aug. 2016, owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/.</p>
</div>
<h4>Multiple citations</h4>
<p>To cite multiple sources in the same parenthetical reference, separate the citations by a semi-colon:</p>
<div class="example">. . . as has been discussed elsewhere (Burke 3; Dewey 21).</div>
<h4>Time-based media sources</h4>
<p>When creating in-text citations for media that has a runtime, such as
 a  movie or podcast, include the range of hours, minutes and seconds 
you  plan to reference, like so (00:02:15-00:02:35).</p>
<h4>When a citation is not needed</h4>
<p>Common sense and ethics should determine your need for documenting 
sources. You do not need to give sources for familiar proverbs, 
well-known quotations or common knowledge. Remember, this is a 
rhetorical choice, based on audience. If you're writing for an expert 
audience of a scholarly journal, for example, they'll have different 
expectations of what constitutes common knowledge.</p>
