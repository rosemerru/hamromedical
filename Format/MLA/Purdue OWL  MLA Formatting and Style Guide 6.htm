<h2>MLA Works Cited Page: Books</h2>
<div id="resourcebox"><p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p><p>MLA (Modern 
Language Association) style is most commonly used to write papers and 
cite sources within the liberal arts and humanities. This resource, 
updated to reflect the <em>MLA Handbook</em> (8<sup>th</sup> ed.), 
offers examples for the general format of MLA research papers, in-text 
citations, endnotes/footnotes, and the Works Cited page.<strong></strong></p>  <p></p>
<p><strong>Contributors:</strong>Tony Russell, Allen Brizee, Elizabeth 
Angeli, Russell Keck, Joshua M. Paiz, Michelle Campbell, Rodrigo 
Rodríguez-Fuentes, Daniel P. Kenzie, Susan Wegener, Maryam Ghafoor, 
Purdue OWL Staff<br><strong>Last Edited:</strong> 2017-01-27 12:25:25</p></div>


	<p>When you are gathering book sources, be sure to make note of the 
following bibliographic items: the author name(s), other contributors 
such as translators or editors, the book’s title, editions of the book, 
the publication date, the publisher, and the pagination.</p>
<p>The 8<sup>th</sup> edition of the MLA handbook highlights principles 
over prescriptive practices. Essentially, a writer will need to take 
note of primary elements in every source, such as author, title, etc. 
and then assort them in a general format. Thus, in using this 
methodology, a writer will be able to source a specific item that may 
not be included in this list.</p>
<p>Remember these changes from previous editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commas are used instead of periods between Publisher, Publication Date, and Pagination. </li>
<li>Medium is no longer necessary. </li>
<li>Containers are now a part of the MLA process, in light of technology. Periods should be used between Containers. </li>
<li>DOIs should be used instead of URLS when available. </li>
<li>Use the phrase, “Accessed” instead of listing the date or the abbreviation, “n.d.” </li>
</ul>
<p>Below is the general format for any citation:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Author. Title. Title of container (self contained if
 book), Other contributors (translators or editors), Version (edition), 
Number (vol. and/or no.), Publisher, Publication Date, Location (pages, 
paragraphs URL or DOI). 2<sup>nd</sup> container’s title, Other contributors, Version, Number, Publisher, Publication date, Location, Date of Access (if applicable).</p>
</div>
<h4>Basic Book Format</h4>
<p>The author’s name or a book with a single author's name appears in 
last name, first name format. The basic form for a book citation is:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Last Name, First Name. <em>Title of Book</em>. Publisher, Publication Date.</p>
</div>
<h4>Book with One Author</h4>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Gleick, James. <em>Chaos: Making a New Science</em>. Penguin, 1987.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Henley, Patricia. <em>The Hummingbird House</em>. MacMurray, 1999.</p>
</div>
<h4>Book with More Than One Author</h4>
<p>When a book has multiple authors, order the authors in the same way 
they are presented in the book. The first given name appears in last 
name, first name format; subsequent author names appear in first name 
last name format.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Gillespie, Paula, and Neal Lerner.&nbsp;<em>The Allyn and Bacon Guide to Peer Tutoring</em>. Allyn and Bacon, 2000.</p>
</div>
<p>If there are three or more authors, list only the first author 
followed by the phrase et al. (Latin for "and others") in place of the 
subsequent authors' names. (Note that there is a period after “al” in 
“et al.” Also note that there is never a period after the “et” in “et 
al.”).</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Wysocki, Anne Frances, et al.&nbsp;<em>Writing New Media: Theory and Applications for Expanding the Teaching of Composition</em>. Utah State UP, 2004.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h4>Two or More Books by the Same Author</h4>
<p>List works alphabetically by title. (Remember to ignore articles like
 A, An, and The.) Provide the author’s name in last name, first name 
format for the first entry only. For each subsequent entry by the same 
author, use three hyphens and a period.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Palmer, William J.&nbsp;<em>Dickens and New Historicism</em>. St. Martin's, 1997.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">---.&nbsp;<em>The Films of the Eighties: A Social History</em>. Southern Illinois UP, 1993.</p>
</div>
<h4>Book by a Corporate Author or Organization</h4>
<p>A corporate author may include a commission, a committee, a 
government agency, or a group that does not identify individual members 
on the title page.</p>
<p>List the names of corporate authors in the place where an author’s name typically appears at the beginning of the entry.</p>
<div class="citation example">
<p class="citation">American Allergy Association. <em>Allergies in Children</em>. Random House, 1998.</p>
</div>
<p>When the author and publisher are the same, skip the author, and list
 the title first. Then, list the corporate author only as the publisher.</p>
<div class="citation example">
<p class="citation"><em>Fair Housing—Fair Lending.</em> Aspen Law &amp; Business, 1985.</p>
</div>
<h4>Book with No Author</h4>
<p>List by title of the book. Incorporate these entries alphabetically 
just as you would with works that include an author name. For example, 
the following entry might appear between entries of works written by 
Dean, Shaun and Forsythe, Jonathan.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation"><em>Encyclopedia of Indiana</em>. Somerset, 1993.</p>
</div>
<p>Remember that for an in-text (parenthetical) citation of a book with 
no author, provide the name of the work in the signal phrase and the 
page number in parentheses. You may also use a shortened version of the 
title of the book accompanied by the page number. For more information 
see the In-text Citations for Print Sources with No Known Author section
 of <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/02/">In-text Citations: The Basics</a>.</p>
<h4>A Translated Book</h4>
<p>If you want to emphasize the work rather than the translator, cite as
 you would any other book. Add “translated by” and follow with the 
name(s) of the translator(s).</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Foucault, Michel. <em>Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason</em>. Translated by Richard Howard, Vintage-Random House, 1988.</p>
</div>
<p>If you want to focus on the translation, list the translator as the 
author. In place of the author’s name, the translator’s name appears. 
His or her name is followed by the label, “, editor.” If the author of 
the book does not appear in the title of the book, include the name, 
with a “By” after the title of the book and before the publisher. Note 
that this type of citation is less common and should only be used for 
papers or writing in which translation plays a central role.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Howard, Richard, translator. <em>Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason</em>. By Michel Foucault, Vintage-Random House, 1988.</p>
</div>
<h4>Republished Book</h4>
<p>Books may be republished due to popularity without becoming a new 
edition. New editions are typically revisions of the original work. For 
books that originally appeared at an earlier date and that have been 
republished at a later one, insert the original publication date before 
the publication information.</p>
<p>For books that are new editions (i.e. different from the first or other editions of the book), see An Edition of a Book below.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Butler, Judith. <em>Gender Trouble</em>. 1990. Routledge, 1999.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Erdrich, Louise. <em>Love Medicine</em>. 1984. Perennial-Harper, 1993.</p>
</div>
<h4>An Edition of a Book</h4>
<p>There are two types of editions in book publishing: a book that has 
been published more than once in different editions and a book that is 
prepared by someone other than the author (typically an editor).</p>
<p><strong>A Subsequent Edition</strong></p>
<p>Cite the book as you normally would, but add the number of the edition after the title.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Crowley, Sharon, and Debra Hawhee. <em>Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students</em>. 3rd ed., Pearson, 2004.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>A Work Prepared by an Editor</strong></p>
<p>Cite the book as you normally would, but add the editor after the title with the label, "Edited by"</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Bronte, Charlotte. <em>Jane Eyre</em>. Edited by Margaret Smith, Oxford UP, 1998.</p>
</div>
<h4>Anthology or Collection (e.g. Collection of Essays)</h4>
<p>To cite the entire anthology or collection, list by editor(s) 
followed by a comma and "editor" or, for multiple editors, "editors." 
This sort of entry is somewhat rare. If you are citing a particular 
piece within an anthology or collection (more common), see A Work in an 
Anthology, Reference, or Collection below.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Hill, Charles A., and Marguerite Helmers, editors. <em>Defining Visual Rhetorics</em>. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2004.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Peterson, Nancy J., editor. <em>Toni Morrison: Critical and Theoretical Approaches</em>. Johns Hopkins UP, 1997.</p>
</div>
<h4>A Work in an Anthology, Reference, or Collection</h4>
<p>Works may include an essay in an edited collection or anthology, or a
 chapter of a book. The basic form is for this sort of citation is as 
follows:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Last name, First name. "Title of Essay." <em>Title of Collection</em>, edited by Editor's Name(s), Publisher, Year, Page range of entry.</p>
</div>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Harris, Muriel. "Talk to Me: Engaging Reluctant Writers." <em>A Tutor's Guide: Helping Writers One to One</em>, edited by Ben Rafoth, Heinemann, 2000, pp. 24-34.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Swanson, Gunnar. "Graphic Design Education as a Liberal Art: Design and Knowledge in the University and The 'Real World.'" <em>The Education of a Graphic Designer</em>, edited by Steven Heller, Allworth Press, 1998, pp. 13-24.</p>
</div>
<p>Note on Cross-referencing Several Items from One Anthology: If you 
cite more than one essay from the same edited collection, MLA indicates 
you may cross-reference within your works cited list in order to avoid 
writing out the publishing information for each separate essay. You 
should consider this option if you have several references from a single
 text. To do so, include a separate entry for the entire collection 
listed by the editor's name as below:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Rose, Shirley K., and Irwin Weiser, editors. <em>The Writing Program Administrator as Researcher</em>. Heinemann, 1999.</p>
</div>
<p>Then, for each individual essay from the collection, list the 
author's name in last name, first name format, the title of the essay, 
the editor's last name, and the page range:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">L'Eplattenier, Barbara. "Finding Ourselves in the Past: An Argument for Historical <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Work on WPAs." Rose and Weiser, pp. 131-40.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Peeples, Tim. "'Seeing' the WPA With/Through Postmodern Mapping." Rose and Weiser, pp. 153-67.</p>
</div>
<p>Please note: When cross-referencing items in the works cited list, 
alphabetical order should be maintained for the entire list.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Poem or Short Story Examples</strong>:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Burns, Robert. "Red, Red Rose." <em>100 Best-Loved Poems,</em>&nbsp;edited by Philip Smith, Dover, 1995, p. 26.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Kincaid, Jamaica. "Girl." <em>The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Short Stories</em>, edited by&nbsp;Tobias Wolff, Vintage, 1994, pp. 306-07.</p>
</div>
<p>If the specific literary work is part of the author's own collection 
(all of the works have the same author), then there will be no editor to
 reference:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Whitman, Walt. "I Sing the Body Electric." <em>Selected Poems</em>. Dover, 1991, pp. 12-19.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Carter, Angela. "The Tiger's Bride." <em>Burning Your Boats: The Collected Stories</em>. Penguin, 1995, pp. 154-69.</p>
</div>
<h4>Article in a Reference Book (e.g. Encyclopedias, Dictionaries)</h4>
<p>For entries in encyclopedias, dictionaries, and other reference 
works, cite the piece as you would any other work in a collection but do
 not include the publisher information. Also, if the reference book is 
organized alphabetically, as most are, do not list the volume or the 
page number of the article or item.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">"Ideology." <em>The American Heritage Dictionary</em>. 3rd ed., 1997.</p>
</div>
<h4>A Multivolume Work</h4>
<p>When citing only one volume of a multivolume work, include the volume
 number after the work's title, or after the work's editor or 
translator.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Quintilian. <em>Institutio Oratoria</em>. Translated by H. E. Butler, vol. 2, Loeb-Harvard UP, 1980.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>When citing more than one volume of a multivolume work, cite the 
total number of volumes in the work. Also, be sure in your in-text 
citation to provide both the volume number and page number(s). (See 
Citing Multivolume Works on the In-Text Citations – The Basics page, 
which you can access by following the appropriate link at the bottom of 
this page.)</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Quintilian. <em>Institutio Oratoria</em>. Translated by H. E. Butler, Loeb-Harvard UP, 1980. 4 vols.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>If the volume you are using has its own title, cite the book without 
referring to the other volumes as if it were an independent publication.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Churchill, Winston S. <em>The Age of Revolution</em>. Dodd, 1957.</p>
</div>
<h4>An Introduction, Preface, Foreword, or Afterword</h4>
<p>When citing an introduction, a preface, a foreword, or an afterword, 
write the name of the author(s) of the piece you are citing. Then give 
the name of the part being cited, which should not be italicized or 
enclosed in quotation marks; in italics, provide the name of the work 
and the name of the author of the 
introduction/preface/forward/afterward. Finish the citation with the 
details of publication and page range.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Farrell, Thomas B. Introduction. <em>Norms of Rhetorical Culture</em>, by Farrell, Yale UP, 1993, pp. 1-13.</p>
</div>
<p><em>If the writer of the piece is different from the author of the complete work</em>,
 then write the full name of the principal work's author after the word 
"By." For example, if you were to cite Hugh Dalziel Duncan’s 
introduction of Kenneth Burke’s book Permanence and Change, you would 
write the entry as follows:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Duncan, Hugh Dalziel. Introduction. <em>Permanence and Change: An Anatomy of Purpose,</em>&nbsp;by Kenneth Burke, 1935, 3rd ed., U of California P, 1984, pp. xiii-xliv.</p>
</div>
<h4>Other Print/Book Sources</h4>
<p>Certain book sources are handled in a special way by MLA style.</p>
<p><strong>Book Published Before 1900</strong></p>
<p>Original copies of books published before 1900 are usually defined by
 their place of publication rather than the publisher. Unless you are 
using a newer edition, cite the city of publication where you would 
normally cite the publisher.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Thoreau, Henry David. <em>Excursions</em>. Boston, 1863.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The Bible</strong></p>
<p>Italicize “The Bible” and follow it with the version you are using. 
Remember that your in-text (parenthetical citation) should include the 
name of the specific edition of the Bible, followed by an abbreviation 
of the book, the chapter and verse(s). (See Citing the Bible at&nbsp;<a title="Purdue OWL MLA In-text Citations The Basics" href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/02/">In-Text Citations: The Basics</a>.)</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation"><em>The Bible. </em>Authorized King James Version<em>,</em> Oxford UP, 1998.</p>
<p class="citation">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="citation"><em>The Bible. </em>The New Oxford Annotated Version<em>,</em> 3rd ed., Oxford UP, 2001.</p>
<p class="citation">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="citation"><em>The New Jerusalem Bible. </em>Edited by Susan Jones, Doubleday, 1985.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p><strong>A Government Publication</strong></p>
<p>Cite the author of the publication if the author is identified. 
Otherwise, start with the name of the national government, followed by 
the agency (including any subdivisions or agencies) that serves as the 
organizational author. For congressional documents, be sure to include 
the number of the Congress and the session when the hearing was held or 
resolution passed as well as the report number. US government documents 
are typically published by the Government Printing Office.</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">United States, Congress, Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. <em>Hearing on the Geopolitics of Oil</em>. Government Printing Office, 2007. 110th Congress, 1st session, Senate Report 111-8.</p>
<p class="citation">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="citation">United States, Government Accountability Office. <em>Climate Change: EPA and DOE Should Do More to Encourage Progress Under Two Voluntary Programs</em>. Government Printing Office, 2006.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>A Pamphlet</strong></p>
<p>Cite the title and publication information for the pamphlet just as 
you would a book without an author. Pamphlets and promotional materials 
commonly feature corporate authors (commissions, committees, or other 
groups that does not provide individual group member names). If the 
pamphlet you are citing has no author, cite as directed below. If your 
pamphlet has an author or a corporate author, put the name of the author
 (last name, first name format) or corporate author in the place where 
the author name typically appears at the beginning of the entry. (See 
also Books by a Corporate Author or Organization above.)</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation"><em>Women's Health: Problems of the Digestive System</em>. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2006.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation"><em>Your Rights Under California Welfare Programs</em>. California Department of Social Services, 2007.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Dissertations and Master's Theses</strong></p>
<p>Dissertations and master's theses may be used as sources whether 
published or not. Cite the work as you would a book, but include the 
designation Dissertation (or MA/MS thesis) followed by the 
degree-granting school and the year the degree was awarded.</p>
<p>If the dissertation is published, italicize the title and include the
 publication date. You may also include the University Microfilms 
International (UMI) order number if you choose:</p>
<div class="example">
<p class="citation">Bishop, Karen Lynn. <em>Documenting Institutional Identity: Strategic Writing in the IUPUI Comprehensive Campaign</em>. Dissertation, Purdue University, 2002. UMI, 2004.</p>
